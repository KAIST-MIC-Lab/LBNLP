  abstract  = {This paper proposes a simplified finite-control-set model predictive current control (FCS-MPCC) without mechanical sensors for permanent-magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) in variable-speed wind energy conversion systems. The procedure of selecting the best switching vector is optimized by computing the reference voltage vector (VV) directly from the reference current. Subsequently, the sector where this reference VV is located is determined from its angle. Finally, the cost function is evaluated only for three times to obtain the optimal switching vector. Therefore, the necessity to test all feasible VVs will be avoided, which reduces the calculation burden of the traditional finite-control-set model predictive control method. Moreover, an extended Kalman filter, which is a robust state observer, is proposed to estimate rotor speed, rotor position, and stator inductance of the PMSG. The estimated (filtered) stator currents, instead of the measured currents, are fed back to the prediction model, and therefore, a lower current total harmonic distortion and better noise rejection are realized. Estimation and control performance of the proposed simplified FCS-MPCC method are illustrated by the simulation results for all operation conditions.},

The focus of this work lies on the decoupling of the subsystems with disturbance feedforward using statical and dynamical decoupling networks. By the addition of prediction models the disturbance feedforward is extended to a delay-aware decoupling concept yielding further improvement of the decoupling quality. For the purpose of estimating non-measurable coupling variables and unkown or time-variant plant parameters different concepts of disturbance observers are introduced and investigated. A plant for continuous processing of material is used as an application example which is investigated by simulation. Results from an experimental setup show the practical applicability of the proposed disturbance feedforward. Abstract in Deutsch Die vorliegende Arbeit befasst sich mit der Verbesserung dezentraler Mehrgr{\"o}�enregelungen mit Verfahren der klassischen und modernen Regelungstechnik. Im Zentrum der Aufmerksamkeit steht die Entkopplung der Teilsysteme durch St{\"o}rgr{\"o}�enaufschaltung mit statischen und dynamischen Entkopplungsnetzwerken. Wird die St{\"o}rgr{\"o}�enaufschaltung um Pr{\"a}diktionsmodelle zur pr{\"a}diktiven Vorsteuerung erweitert, kann die Entkopplungsqualit{\"a}t nochmals verbessert werden. Um nicht messbare Koppelgr{\"o}�en und unbekannte oder zeitvariante Streckenparameter zu sch{\"a}tzen, werden verschiedene St{\"o}rgr{\"o}�enbeobachterkonzepte vorgestellt und untersucht. Die entwickelten Verfahren werden am Beispiel einer kontinuierlichen Fertigungsanlage simulativ untersucht und getestet. Experimentelle Ergebnisse an einer Modellarbeitsmaschine zeigen die praktische Anwendbarkeit der vorgeschlagenen St{\"o}rgr{\"o}�enaufschaltung.},

Control strategy selects in every sampling period voltage vector sequence, and calculates duty cycles in order to minimize instantaneous active and reactive power errors. Moreover due to virtual flux approach, presented algorithm works without grid voltage sensor. Combined advantages of predictive control and sensor less operation gives very universal control with high dynamic response in transient states as well as good performance in steady states.},

The algorithm is based on a signal-injection method with a random-based perturbation pattern applied to a common direct-torque-controlled drive. Among motor parameters, only the stator resistance is required to perform the automatic procedure. Simulations and experimental results are presented in the paper, demonstrating the benefits of the proposed algorithm. The solution is easily extended to any ac drive.},

  abstract      = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57\%, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

  abstract  = {Wind energy has drawn worldwide attention. Because of simple structure, high efficiency, stable operation and other inherent advantages, variable speed constant frequency (VSCF) direct-drive wind power generation system using permanent magnetic synchronous generator(PMSG) is the development trend and one of the focuses of wind power generation system, on which this paper researches through its converter's topological. To be the interface between PMSG and the grid, typical converter topology structure of direct-driven wind power system with PMSG are analyzed, including the diode rectifier + DC to DC converter + inverter, and the back to back double PWM converter. The topological characteristics and applications of some high-voltage, high-power converters are introduced in detail, including Diode-clamped multi-level converter, Cascaded H-bridge multilevel converter and Flyingcapacitor multilevel converter. Their implementations, working principles, advantages and disadvantages are discussed and compared. Judging from the current situation, for the advantages of low-cost and simple control strategy, diodeclamped three-level PWM converter is the hot spot of current converting technique study for direct-driven wind power system.},

In this way, torque and stator flux references can be reached within one sample period. With the use of multilevel space phasor modulation, low torque and flux ripple are possible with fixed sample rate. Experimental and simulation results are presented in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy},

feedback control of the DC-link voltage in grid-connected

a linearized system model, compute the feedback gains via pole
placement and present an analytical expression for the gains in
dependence of the actual operating point. The linearized model
also allows to illustrate the non-minimum phase behavior of
the DC-link dynamics for certain operation points. By online
adjustment of the feedback gains, we achieve a stable closed-
loop system behavior for different operation points (e.g. dif-
ferent reference set-points and load steps). Simulation results
illustrate the control performance of a proportional state-
feedback controller, a state-feedback controller with integral
action and a proportional-integral state-feedback controller.},

  abstract  = {The optimal feedforward torque control problem is tackled and solved analytically for synchronous machines while stator resistance and cross-coupling inductance are explicitly considered. Analytical solutions for the direct and quadrature optimal reference currents are found for all major operation strategies such as Maximum Torque per Current (MTPC) (or often called as Maximum Torque per Ampere (MTPA)), Maximum Current (MC), Field Weakening (FW), Maximum Torque per Voltage (MTPV) and Maximum Torque per Flux (MTPF). Numerical methods (approximating the optimal solutions only) or simplifying assumptions (neglecting stator resistance and/or cross-coupling inductance) are no longer necessary. The presented results are based on one simple idea: all optimization problems (e.g. MTPC, MTPV or MTPF) with their respective constraints (e.g. current or voltage limit) and the computation of the intersection point(s) of voltage ellipse, current circle, or torque, MTPC, MTPV and MTPF hyperbolas are reformulated implicitly as quadrics (quadratic surfaces) which allow to solve the feedforward torque control problem by invoking the Lagrangian formalism and by finding the roots of a fourth-order polynomial analytically. The proposed solutions are applicable to any anisotropic (or isotropic) synchronous machine independent of the underlying current control strategy.},

For this purpose the three-phase RSM is modeled in a rotor (d-q) reference frame. The Field Oriented Control is then developed for Reluctance Synchronous Motor in a rotating (d-q) reference frame attached to rotor flux and applied to the machine model. The results obtained shows that the Field Oriented Control have proved to be a powerful control strategy with the Reluctance Synchronous Motor, giving better performance and faster torque transient (i.e. less torque settling time). Field Oriented Control has also proved its ability to improve the motor stability and keeps its synchronism at high loading conditions.},

The proposed approach allows to manipulate all the system variables simultaneously, including mechanical and electrical variables in a single control law. The state feedback is achieved with a reduced order extended Kalman filter, which observes the non-measured variables as well as reduces the impact of measurement noise. The performance of the control strategy is shown through simulation and experimental results in a 4 [kW] laboratory prototype.},

  abstract  = {A voltage-sourced rectifier control scheme for use with AC/DC/AC variable speed drives is presented. A control scheme is derived that directly calculates the duration of time spent on the zero state and on each switching state adjacent to the reference vector, over a constant switching interval, in order to drive the line current vector to the reference vector. In addition, under transient conditions, when deadbeat control is not possible, a control scheme is presented that ensures that the line current vector is driven in the direction of the reference current vector. The current reference for the rectifier controller is derived from the bus voltage error and a feedforward term based on the estimated converter output power. The proposed space vector-based rectifier regulator is shown to exhibit improved harmonic and transient performance over existing per-phase duty cycle prediction methods, especially at modulation indices near unity. The deadbeat control of the rectifier input current is accomplished every half-cycle with constant switching frequency while still symmetrically distributing the zero state within the half-cycle period},

It is shown that an equivalence in the frequency domain does only hold if simplifying assumptions are satisfied. As consequence of the equivalence, both closed- loop control performances are identical with respect to closed-loop dynamics and steady-state accuracy. The control performance will only differ if their implementation is not done correctly or the time delay induced by the voltage source inverter becomes significant. To the best knowledge of the author, equivalence of PR and PI controllers with anti-windup has not been shown before (in particular not in state space).},

addition, we introduce integral error feedback which assures
steady-state accuracy for (piece-wise) constant disturbances and
reference signals. The proposed MPC scheme is applied to grid-
side current control of grid-connected power converters with
LCL-filter. Simulation results illustrate and compare the control

The nonlinear controller design is based on the tuning rule ``Magnitude Optimum criterion'' [1]. Due to the nonlinear flux linkage, the current dynamics of RSMs are highly nonlinear and, so, the parameters of the PI controllers and the disturbance compensation feedforward control must be adjusted online (e.g., for each sampling instant). The theoretical results are illustrated and validated by simulation and measurement results.},

  abstract    = {We discuss non-ideal torque control in wind turbine systems (WTS). Most high-level controllers generate a reference torque which is then send to the underlying electrical drive system (generator+inverter) of the WTS to steer the turbine/generator to its optimal operation point (depending on the wind speed). The energy production heavily depends on the mechanical power (i.e. the product of rotational speed and generator torque). However, since torque sensors in the MW range are not available or extremely expensive, the torque controllers are implemented as feedforward controllers and, therefore, are inherently sensitive to parameter variations/uncertainties. Based on real wind data and a dynamical WTS model, we discuss causes and impacts of non-ideal (feedforward) torque control on the energy production and the gross earnings.},

It can be guaranteed that the control error converges to
zero. The introduced structure extends the original plant to
an auxiliary system, which is still controllable with High-
Gain based concepts. Funnel-Control, a sophisticated High-
Gain based time-varying control strategy, is re-examined to
illustrate the advantages of the extension. The extension neither
affects the controllability of the orignial plant nor requires a
supplementary (adaptive) controller design, but improves the
achievable control performance by absolute accuracy},

  abstract  = {This paper deals with discrete-time models and current control methods for synchronous motors with a magnetically salient rotor structure, such as interior permanent-magnet synchronous motors (IPMs) and synchronous reluctance motors (SyRMs). The dynamic performance of current controllers based on the continuous-time motor model is limited, especially if the ratio of the sampling frequency to the fundamental frequency is low. An exact closed-form hold-equivalent discrete motor model is derived. The zero-order hold (ZOH) of the stator-voltage input is modeled in stationary coordinates, where it physically is. An analytical discrete-time pole-placement design method for two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) proportional-integral (PI) current control is proposed. The proposed method is easy to apply: only the desired closed-loop bandwidth and the three motor parameters (Rs, Ld, Lq) are required. The robustness of the proposed current control design against parameter errors is analyzed. The controller is experimentally verified using a 6.7- kW SyRM drive.},

  abstract  = {A sensorless control method based on novel extended electromotive force (EEMF) models considering magnetic saturation is proposed for synchronous reluctance motors (SynRMs). Since motor parameters, particularly inductances, vary largely in SynRMs, a precise sensorless control is necessary for fully considering such variations. In this paper, the EEMF model, taking into consideration magnetic saturation, is derived and is applied to a position estimation method. The two EEMF models caused by a difference in the d-axis direction are shown, and the appropriate EEMF model that can suppress a position estimation error caused by the deviation of inductance parameters is proposed. Moreover, an online parameter identification method for sensorless control in middle- or high-speed ranges is proposed. The necessity for the use of the model, taking into consideration magnetic saturation, is verified by experiments. The proposed sensorless control system is shown useful by experiments},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes two control algorithms for a sensorless speed control of a PMSM. One is a new low pass filter. This filter is designed to have the variable cutoff frequency according to the rotor speed. And the phase delay angle is so small as to be ignored not only in the low speed region but also in the high speed region including the field weakening region. Sensorless control of a PMSM can be guaranteed without any delay angle by using the proposed low pass filter. The other is a new iterative sliding mode observer (I-SMO). Generally the sliding mode observer (SMO) has the attractive features of the robustness to disturbances, and parameter variations. In the high speed region the switching gain of SMO must be large enough to operate the sliding mode stably. But the estimated currents and back EMF can not help having much ripple or chattering components especially in the high speed region including the flux weakening region. Using I-SMO can reduce chattering components of the estimated currents and back EMF in all speed regions without any help of the expensive hardware such as the high performance DSP and A/D converter. Experimental results show the usefulness of the proposed two algorithms for the sensorless drive system of a PMSM.},

  abstract  = {A usual argument against GPC is its demand for processing power. In industry, however, this is not a serious argument if better control performance can be reached. As the development of new processors with increased performance takes place rather rapidly, the lag of processing power never was a long-term issue to prevent new algorithms from being introduced. This paper presents a practical realization of generalized predictive control (GPC) for field oriented control of induction machines. The results are compared with conventional PI-control. Considering the strong real time conditions of drive applications, implementation aspects according to the great calculation effort in case of GPC are discussed to contribute to closing the gap between theory and practice},

The parameters for this model have been determined experimentally and its validity was confirmed by laboratory measurements. For the implementation of sensorless control schemes of the synchronous reluctance machine the decoupling of the equations according to the model is necessary. Nevertheless, the model with extensive parameter fields is too complex. Therefore, simpler models are derived from the complete one and their limits of application are shown in the paper.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a sensorless speed control strategy for a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) based on a new sliding-mode observer (SMO), which substitutes a sigmoid function for the signum function with a variable boundary layer. In order to apply a sensorless PMSM control which is robust against parameter fluctuations and disturbances, a high-speed SMO is proposed, which estimates the rotor position and the angular velocity from the back EMF. In the conventional SMO, a low-pass filter and an additional position compensation of the rotor are used to reduce the chattering problem that is commonly found in the SMO using the signum function. In order to overcome the time delay caused by the low-pass filter, in this research, a sigmoid function is used for the switching function instead of the signum function. Also, the variation in the stator resistance is estimated to improve the steady-state performance of the SMO. The stability of the proposed SMO was verified using the Lyapunov second method to determine the observer gain. The validity of the proposed high-speed PMSM sensorless velocity control has been demonstrated with simulations and real experiments.},

It has been implemented using a high-speed digital processor DSP96002. Experimental results for a 120 W axially-laminated synchronous reluctance motor are presented and compared with operation with a speed sensor and simulations. A base speed range of 400-1500 RPM has been achieved. The top speed was extended to 2750 RPM using flux-weakening. The drive can be applied a full-load step-change within this speed range without losing synchronism},

  abstract  = {With the advances of power electronic technology, direct-driven permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) have increasingly drawn the interest of wind turbine manufacturers. At the present time, a commercial PMSG wind turbine primarily makes use of a passive rectifier followed by an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) inverter. Although a PMSG wind turbine with two back-to-back voltage source IGBT converters is considered more efficient, it has not been widely adopted by the wind power industry. This paper investigates both the conventional and a novel vector control mechanism for a PMSG wind turbine that has two side-by-side voltage source pulsewidth modulation converters. The proposed approach is based on a direct-current vector control mechanism for control of both machine- and grid-side converters of a PMSG wind turbine. Then, an optimal control strategy is developed for integrated control of PMSG maximum power extraction, reactive power, and grid voltage support controls. A transient system simulation using SimPowerSystem is built to investigate the performance of the conventional and proposed control techniques for the PMSG wind turbine under steady and gusty wind conditions. This paper shows that when using the direct-current vector control structure, a PMSG system has excellent performance in various aspects.},

Until now, the strategies based on this method fulfill completely the requirements of drive technology. However, due to the system characteristics, an arbitrary improvement of the controller properties is not possible. Predictive or precalculating control methods which need no controller cascade are an alternative. Main focus of this work is to examine model-based predictive controllers for their applicability in drive technology. These methods with their high prediction horizon are well-known from classic control theory and in process engineering they are applied with great success. Several strategies are presented, explained and evaluated, whereas, at the same time, the interested reader gets advice for the implementation of these methods. Since model-based predictive control is, until now, not very common in drive technology, this work also includes detailed derivations of the control algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Since more than 20 years the so-called ``field oriented control'' is state-of-the-art for electrical drives. Strategies based on this principle fulfil nearly all demands of drive technology today. Due to its basic ideas, the performance of field oriented control cannot be improved without limitations. Furthermore, linear controllers always produce a continuously valued output. Hence, for controlling an inverter additional components, which discretise the output of the controller, have to be inserted. Predictive controllers, which allow to overcome this drawback, are known in drive control for quite a long time. Nevertheless all predictive control schemes proposed for controlling electrical drives until today only precalculate the system behaviour for one single future sampling cycle. Powerful control strategies like model predictive control, well-known in chemical engineering, allow higher prediction horizons, but these strategies have not yet been used for drive control. This paper proposes a new predictive controller for electrical drives based on model predictive control, which allows optimal control of the inverter directly, i.e. without using any kind of modulator. In contrast to all predictive strategies published so far for drive control, the new controller optimises the control action not only for the next sampling period, but for a longer prediction horizon},

Excellent control performance is shown to be possible, which indicates that synchronous reluctance motors can be suitably applied to high performance drive systems},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a comparative study of three predictive current control schemes for permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drives. The first control scheme predicts the future evolution of the currents for each possible configuration of the inverter legs. Then, the switching state which minimizes a given cost function is selected and applied during the next sampling time. The second control scheme uses a modulator to apply two configurations of the inverter legs during a computation period. Among these configurations, one leads to null voltages. The duration of the other configuration is calculated in order to minimize the distance between the obtained state vector and the desired one. The third control scheme uses a model of the PMSM in order to predict the stator voltages which allows us to reach the desired currents after one modulation period. An algebraic method is presented to compute the duty cycle of each leg of the inverter in a direct manner. These control schemes are detailed and tested using the same switching frequency on the same test bench (1.6-kW PMSM drive). A simulation study is performed in order to compare sensitivity to parameters of each control scheme. Experiments confirm the simulation results.},

The comparison is based on cost and annual energy yield for a given wind climate. The DFIG3G is a cheap solution using standard components. The DFIG1G seems the most attractive in terms of energy yield divided by cost. The DDPMG has the highest energy yield, but although it is cheaper than the DDSG, it is more expensive than the generator systems with gearbox},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a wind speed and rotor position sensorless control for wind turbines directly driving permanent magnetic generators (PMGs). A sliding-mode observer is designed to estimate the rotor position of the PMG by using the measured stator currents and the commanded stator voltages obtained from the control scheme of the machine-side converter of the PMG wind turbine. The rotor speed of the PMG (i.e., the turbine shaft speed) is estimated from its back electromotive force using a model adaptive reference system observer. Based on the measured output electrical power and estimated rotor speed of the PMG, the mechanical power of the turbine is estimated by taking into account the power losses of the wind turbine generator system. A back-propagation artificial neural network is then designed to estimate the wind speed in real time by using the estimated turbine shaft speed and mechanical power. The estimated wind speed is used to determine the optimal shaft speed reference for the PMG control system. Finally, a sensorless control is developed for the PMG wind turbines to continuously generate the maximum electrical power without using any wind speed or rotor position sensors. The validity of the proposed estimation and control algorithms are shown by simulation studies on a 3-kW PMG wind turbine and are further demonstrated by experimental results on a 300-W practical PMG wind turbine.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, the synchronous reluctance (SyncRel) motor received much attention for many applications due to its simple and robust construction. When using the principle of vector control, it is possible to achieve optimal operation of SyncRel motors for all loads and speeds. A suitable control strategy can be implemented to achieve maximum torque per ampere, high efficiency and maximum power factor. However, the control of a SyncRel motor is highly affected by both magnetic saturation and high iron losses. A new strategy to achieve maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) is proposed in this paper. The motor behavior under vector control is analyzed considering both saturation and iron losses. A simple relationship between the developed torque and d-axis current has been obtained for MTPA conditions. After experimental check, the obtained relation has been implemented in a vector control algorithm. The proposed control strategy has been successfully implemented with the aid of an experimental setup.},

  abstract  = {Abstract in English The objective of this thesis is the identification and model predictive control design for nonlinear systems with a state space approach. Nonlinearities are approximated by neural networks included in a dynamic observer. The training of the networks is guaranteed stable. The result is the approximation of nonlinear characteristics and non measurable state variables. The predictive control design is based on a state space model and the linearization of the nonlinearity around the reference trajectory. The consideration of bounds in the control law results in a quadratic program, which is solved online. The controllers's stability is guaranteed in accordance with Lyapunov's theory. Besides the necessary theory, simulations and practical implementations of identification and control are shown for a two-mass system, a continuous processing plant and a radio telescope. Abstract in Deutsch Diese {PhD} thesis liefert einen Beitrag zur nichtlinearen Systemidentifikation und zum Entwurf einer nichtlinearen pr{\"a}diktiven Regelung im Zustandsraum. Nichtlinearit{\"a}ten werden innerhalb eines Beobachters durch neuronale Netze approximiert, die durch stabile Lerngesetze online trainiert werden. Das Ergebnis ist die Sch{\"a}tzung nichtlinearer Kennlinien und nicht messbarer Zustandsgr{\"o}�en. Der Entwurf der darauf aufbauenden pr{\"a}diktiven Regelung erfolgt im Zustandsraum durch Linearisierung der Nichtlinearit{\"a}t um die Referenztrajektorie. Unter Ber{\"u}cksichtigung von Begrenzungen ergibt sich ein quadratisches Programm als Optimierungsaufgabe, das online gel{\"o}st wird. F{\"u}r die Regelung ist Stabilit{\"a}t nach Lyapunov gew{\"a}hrleistet. Neben den theoretischen Ableitungen erfolgt die simulative und praktische Validierung von Identifikation und Regelung an einem Zweimassensystem, einer kontinuierlichen Fertigungsanlage und einem Radioteleskop.},

  abstract  = {The wind power industry has expanded greatly during the past few years, has served a growing market, and has spawned the development of larger wind turbines. Different designs and technical advances now make it possible to erect wind turbines offshore. The fast expansion of the wind power market faces some problems. The new designs are not always fully tested, and the designed 20-year lifetime is typically never achieved before the next generation of turbines are erected. This paper presents results from an investigation of failure statistics from four sources, i.e., two separate sources from Sweden, one from Finland, and one from Germany. Statistics reveal reliability performance of the different components within the wind turbine. The gearbox is the most critical, because downtime per failure is high compared to the other components. The statistical data for larger turbines also show trends toward higher, ever-increasing failure frequency when compared to small turbines, which have a decreasing failure rate over the operational years},

The control strategy minimizes quality functions, which represent the desired behavior of the converter. At the inverter side, the load current error is minimized, while at the input side, the active and reactive powers are controlled directly. The main advantages of this method are: no need of linear current controllers, coordinates transformations or modulators for converter and inverter. The rectifier operates with sinusoidal input currents and unity power factor, while sinusoidal currents are generated out at the inverter load.},

The torque controller optimizes a quadratic cost consisting of control error and machine losses repeatedly, accounting the voltage and current limitations. The scheme extensively relies on optimization, to meet the runtime limitation, a suboptimal algorithm based on differential flatness, continuous parameterization and linear programming is introduced. The multivariable controller exploits cross-coupling effects in the long-range constrained predictive control strategy. The optimization results in fast and smooth torque dynamics while inherently using field-weakening to improve the power efficiency and the current dynamics in high speed operation. As distinctive MPC feature, constraint handling is improved, instead of just saturating the control input, field weakening is applied dynamically to bypass the voltage limitation. The performance of the scheme is demonstrated by experimental and numerical results.},

A permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) is used as a variable speed generator in the proposed wind energy system. In order to achieve the maximum power control of wind turbine across a wide range of wind speeds, a dynamic modeling and simulation of wind system with battery energy storage including wind disturbances is presented in this paper. This model should be able to support the analysis of the interaction between the mechanical structure of the wind turbine and the electrical load during different operational modes. These wind turbine concept models can be used and even extended for the study of different aspects, e.g. the assessment of power quality, control strategies, connection of the wind turbine at different types of grid and storage systems},

A good observer-based method to obtain state variables for use in the control law is always pursued by researchers. Observation algorithms make use of the machine model equations and allow the estimation of rotor speed and/or flux from the motor terminal measurement of current and voltage. Among different observation methods the sliding mode observer is a promising approach. This paper attempts to provide a status review and synopsis of the main approaches used in the sliding mode observer design for electric machines. Both induction machine and permanent magnet synchronous machine are covered in this paper. The research work expands from flux estimation, machine parameter estimation to sensorless control issue.},

  abstract  = {Direct model predictive control (DMPC) is an attractive control method, in particular, for multilevel converters. However, the computation time for classical DMPC schemes increases exponentially with the number of switching states and, compared to modulation-based controllers, real-time implementation may not be feasible. In this paper, two computationally efficient DMPC schemes with hexagon candidate region (HCR) and triangle candidate region (TCR) for torque and power control of three-level neutral-point clamped back-to-back converters in wind turbine systems with permanent-magnet synchronous generator are proposed. By an appropriate selection of the candidate regions, the number of reasonable switching states is drastically reduced which saves computation time up to 55% for HCR and up to 83% for TCR, respectively. The computational efficiency improvements and the control performances of the proposed DMPC schemes are compared and validated by real-time implementations on an field programmable gate array (FPGA) system and by measurement results at a lab-constructed test bench. The achieved control performance of the proposed methods is comparable with that of the classical DMPC, while the computation times are drastically reduced.},

  abstract  = {Direct control techniques are interesting alternatives, in particular, for drive systems with multi-
level and/or multi-phase power converters, for which the modulator design becomes rather
complex. This work presents a direct model predictive current control (DMPCC) method for
permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drives fed by three level neutral point clamped
(3L-NPC) power converters. The proposed DMPCC method takes the currents, neutral point
voltage balancing and switching frequency regulations as control targets and is implemented
on a FPGA based real-time controller. Its control performances are compared with the conven-
tional direct torque control method with switching table (DTC-TB). Experimental results confirm
that the proposed DMPCC scheme may outperform the conventional DTC-TB technique in
steady-state with reduced tuning efforts},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a method to maximize the driving efficiency of synchronous reluctance motors having cross-magnetic saturation effect. A novel method to calculate the optimum d- and q-axis currents that minimize the loss is proposed. In this method, an approximation equation for expressing inductance variation and a simple repetition method are employed to consider the cross-magnetic saturation. This method can determine the optimum d- and q-axis currents quickly and automatically, without using two-dimensional function tables. By installing this method in a digital signal processor for motor control, the authors realized a novel loss minimization controller capable of considering cross magnetic saturation. The validity of the proposed method is verified from simulation and experimental results on a 1.1kW flux barrier type synchronous reluctance motor.},

Based on a constrained Lagrangian formulation that takes the basic circuit laws into account, the equations of motion of a nonlinear electric circuit consisting of inductors, capacitors, resistors and voltage sources are derived. The resulting differential-algebraic system can be reduced by performing the variational principle on a reduced space. It is shown under which conditions the corresponding reduced Lagrangian is regular and thus the equations of motion transform to an ordinary differential equation system. Based on a discrete variational formulation, a variational integrator for the structure-preserving simulation of nonlinear electric circuits is derived

are classified by the ratio of magnet torque to the reluctance torque and their features described, then the trend
of the motor design and the electromagnetic material for highly efficient PMSM is shown. The technologies
that help to reduce the vibration and noise are also described, and the recently developed PMSMs for traction

  abstract         = {Electrically excited synchronous motor (EESM) has the characteristics of high order, nonlinear and strong coupling, so it is difficult to be controlled. However, it has the advantages of adjustable power factor, high efficiency, and high precision torque control, so it is widely used in high-power applications. The accuracy of a flux observer influences the speed control system of EESM. Based on state observer in modern control theory and electrical excitation synchronous machine state equation, a reduced-order flux observer is designed. Using the first-order difference method and forward bilinear transformation method, the reduced-order flux observer is discrete, and the stability of the motor system is analyzed. The analysis shows that the stability of the system using the bilinear transformation method is better than that using the first order forward difference method. In motor operation, motor parameters will be affected by the factors of temperature, magnetic saturation, and motor frequency. In this paper, the influence of parameter variation on the motor system is studied by using the variation of the pole distribution. Finally, the speed regulation system using the reduced-order observer is simulated, which verifies the accuracy of the reduced-order flux observer observation.},

induction motors for battery-electrical-vehicles (BEV). With three
electrical torque equations based on stator current, stator voltage
and stator flux density, we display the overload potential of an
induction motor. The traditional efficiency map of an induction
motor is extended by a so-called overload-area. An algorithm
for sizing an induction motor generates a set of input variables
which will be forwarded to a driving cycle simulation. As a
result of downsizing, the motor will be actuated more often in
the overload-area and in more efficient regimes, leading to a
significant reduction of energy consumption.},

  abstract  = {In the introduction a general discussion of unsymmetrical systems of co-planar vectors leads to the conclusion that they may be represented by symmetrical systems of the same number of vectors, the number of symmetrical systems required to define the given system being equal to its degrees of freedom. A few trigonometrical theorems which are to be used in the paper are called to mind. The paper is subdivided into three parts, an abstract of which follows. It is recommended that only that part of Part I up to formula (33) and the portion dealing with star-delta transformations be read before proceeding with Part II. Part I deals with the resolution of unsymmetrical groups of numbers into symmetrical groups. These numbers may represent rotating vectors of systems of operators. A new operator termed the sequence operator is introduced which simplifies the manipulation. Formulas are derived for three-phase circuits. Star-delta transformations for symmetrical co-ordinates are given and expressions for power deduced. A short discussion of harmonics in three-phase systems is given. Part II deals with the practical application of this method to symmetrical rotating machines operating on unsymmetrical circuits. General formulas are derived and such special cases, as the single-phase induction motor, synchronous motor-generator, phase converters of various types, are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Parameter identification for advanced friction models is the most demanding task and involves a wide range of experimental dynamic analysis. The identification results directly affect the quality of the friction model and significantly depend on the setup. While many setups have been proposed to investigate the various characteristics of friction, rather less attention has been paid to designing one that is practical for parameter identification dedicated to certain common models. An experimental setup featuring simplicity, flexibility and good versatility is proposed here. The setup consists of a mass block connected to a motor-powered ball screw mechanism. Such a block slides on a metal base and the friction at the contact junction is varied accordingly. The materials and lubricants in the contact surface can be easily altered if needed. A capacitance displacement sensor is designed and installed at where the precise presliding profiles can be captured. The experimental setup, the calibration procedure for the displacement sensor and the experimental results are presented. It is shown that the experimental data produced by our setup leads to the success in parameter identification procedures of the selected friction models. Some limitations of the friction models, from the perspective of parameter identification, are discussed.},

The voltage rating of commercial Si insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) is limited to 6.5 kV, and at higher voltages, the maximum switching frequency featured by these semiconductors is no more than several hundred hertz. The development of optimal switching schemes, such as selective harmonics elimination and selective harmonics mitigation, was mainly due to the limitation in switching performance of Si-based semiconductors for high-power converters [2], [3]. Moreover, no Si-based semiconductor is reported to be capable of operating beyond 200?C [1].},

The smart transformer (ST) is an SST that provides ancillary services to the distribution and transmission grids to optimize their performance. Hence, the focus shifts from hardware advantages to functionalities. One of the most desired functionalities is the dc connectivity to enable a hybrid distribution system. For this reason, the ST architecture shall be composed of at least two power stages. The standard design procedure for this kind of system is to design each power stage for the maximum load. However, this design approach might limit additional services, like the reactive power compensation on the medium voltage (MV) side, and it does not consider the load regulation capability of the ST on the low voltage (LV) side. If the SST is tailored to the services that it shall provide, different stages will have different designs, so that the ST is no longer a mere application of the SST but an entirely new subject.},

A consequence of this result is the possibility to stabilize switched DAEs via fast switching. We also study partial averaging in case the consistency projectors do not satisfy the conditions for convergence; the averaged system is then still a switched system, but is simpler than the original. The practical interest of the theoretical averaging results is demonstrated through the analysis of the dynamics of a switched electrical circuit.},

  abstract  = {The dq0 transformation is increasingly used today to model distributed sources, complex loads, renewable generators, and power electronics-based devices. This paper presents a dynamic model of long transmission lines that is based entirely on dq0 quantities, and demonstrates how such a model may be integrated with emerging dq0 models of large-scale networks. The model is first developed in the frequency domain and then converted to the time domain, using a state-space representation which inputs and outputs are dq0 signals. The proposed approach may be used to evaluate the stability and dynamic behavior of power systems that include long transmission lines, taking advantage of the dq0 reference frame inherent benefits. This is demonstrated on the basis of a 7-bus network, which shows how long transmission lines influence the network dynamics and stability. The proposed models and examples are provided as a part of an open-source software.},

These systems involve linear systems which can take a number of different realizations based on the state of an underlying finite state process. The averaging technique (based on a formula from Lie algebras known as the Backer-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula) provides a single system matrix as an approximation to the hybrid system. The two errors discussed are: (1) the error induced by the truncation of the BCH series expansion and (2) the error between the actual hybrid system and its average. A simple sufficient stability test is proposed to check the asymptotic behavior of this error. In addition, conditions are derived that allow the use of state feedback instead of averaging to arrive at a time-invariant system matrix},

  abstract  = {The problem of optimal control of power distribution systems is becoming increasingly compelling due to the progressive penetration of distributed energy resources in this specific layer of the electrical infrastructure. Distribution systems are, indeed, experiencing significant changes in terms of operation philosophies that are often based on optimal control strategies relying on the computation of linearized dependencies between controlled (e.g., voltages, frequency in case of islanding operation) and control variables (e.g., power injections, transformers tap positions). As the implementation of these strategies in real-time controllers imposes stringent time constraints, the derivation of analytical dependency between controlled and control variables becomes a non-trivial task to be solved. With reference to optimal voltage and power flow controls, this paper aims at providing an analytical derivation of node voltages and line currents as a function of the nodal power injections and transformers tap-changers positions. Compared to other approaches presented in the literature, the one proposed here is based on the use of the [Y] compound matrix of a generic multi-phase radial unbalanced network. In order to estimate the computational benefits of the proposed approach, the relevant improvements are also quantified versus traditional methods. The validation of the proposed method is carried out by using both IEEE 13 and 34 nodes test feeders. The paper finally shows the use of the proposed method for the problem of optimal voltage control applied to the IEEE 34 node test feeder.},

Accordingly, wind turbines do not possess a natural response to frequency excursions. In this paper three different control concepts that enable wind turbines to participate on grid frequency control are introduced. The first uses pitch control together with the provision of reserve capacity by operating the wind turbine in part load mode. The second and third strategies utilize the kinetic energy of wind turbines to provide frequency support for a limited time following a disturbance. One involves a control scheme which initiates the partial release of the kinetic energy immediately after the frequency drop is detected. Replenishing the stored energy and thus accelerating the wind turbine then follows during the frequency recovery phase. The third option calls for the wind turbine to accelerate first, and then decelerate by discharging energy during the phase of the disturbance in which the frequency is approaching its minimum, thus limiting the frequency drop more effectively. For all three concepts the control structures are presented, and the effectiveness of the suggested methods is demonstrated using simulation results.},

  abstract  = {Energy Storage Systems (ESS) are expected to play a significant role in regulating the frequency of future electric power systems. Increased penetration of renewable generation, and reduction in the inertia provided by large synchronous generators, are likely to increase the severity and regularity of frequency events in synchronous AC power systems. By supplying or absorbing power in response to deviations from the nominal frequency and imbalances between supply and demand, the rapid response of ESS will provide a form of stability which cannot be matched by conventional network assets. However, the increased complexity of ESS operational requirements and design specifications introduces challenges when it comes to the realisation of their full potential through existing frequency response service markets: new service markets will need to be designed to take advantage of the capabilities of ESS. This paper provides new methods to analyse and assessing the performance of ESS within existing service frameworks, using real-time network simulation and power hardware in the loop. These methods can be used to introduce improvements in existing services and potentially create new ones. Novel statistical techniques have been devised to quantify the design and operational requirements of ESS providing frequency regulation services. These new techniques are demonstrated via an illustrative service design and high-resolution frequency data from the Great Britain transmission system.},

A simplified GB power system model was used to investigate the contribution of EVs to primary frequency response.

A case study shows results for the year 2020. Three EV charging strategies: “dumb” charging, “off-peak” charging, and “smart” charging, were compared. Simulation results show that utilizing EVs to stabilize the grid frequency in the GB system can significantly reduce frequency deviations.

The virtual output is chosen in such a way that the tracking error approaches it from the initial time and the difference between the virtual output and the tracking error can be made arbitrarily small. Assuming that the state derivatives are not available for feedback we use a high-gain observer to estimate the derivatives and construct the virtual output.

The proposed FPS-PLL is based on the finite control set-model predictive control (FCS-MPC) concept, where a finite number of rotor positions are used to estimate the back electromotive force (EMF) of the PMSG. Then, the estimated rotor position which minimizes a certain cost function is selected to be the optimal rotor position. This eliminates the need of a fixed-gain proportional-integral (PI) controller which is commonly utilized in the conventional PLL.

  abstract  = {Traditional model predictive control (MPC) cost functions, when utilising long prediction horizons (N{\textgreater}10) in power inverter applications, have demonstrated harmonic performances approaching that of schemes based on offline-generated optimal pulse patterns. However, long prediction horizons often prohibitively increase computational load. A different approach to maximising harmonic performance is taken in this paper. It is shown that shaping the output voltage spectra using a simple feedback mechanism can significantly reduce the length of the required prediction horizon, facilitating a feasible computational load. When a short-horizon cost function is augmented by the feedback mechanism an excellent trade-off between harmonic performance and switching loss is achieved, even with a prediction horizon of one. It is also shown that the feedback mechanism can be used to improve input reference tracking. Experimental verification of the proposed modulator is performed on a two-level three-phase inverter.},

  abstract  = {Iron losses in permanent-magnet synchronous machines form a larger portion of the total losses than in induction machines and, hence, more importance should be given to the iron losses. Previously, models have been presented for the calculations of these losses, but these models still rely on finite-element simulations to obtain correction factors, which are substantial, to apply to the theoretically derived formulas in order to obtain good agreement with the experimental data. This paper points out the source of this correction factor: the neglect of the excess eddy-current loss component. In many cases, this loss component dominates the total iron losses and needs to be incorporated in the theoretical considerations. The paper also provides a more complete model of iron loss, which greatly reduces the need for calculating the correction factors using the finite-element method (FEM). This more complete model reduces design time, especially when a number of candidate designs need to be analyzed. Otherwise, the calculation of the correction factors using FEM would be cumbersome, as the correction factors tend to be nonlinear.},

  abstract  = {Permanent-magnet (PM) motors offer potential energy savings as compared with induction motors because of the virtual elimination of rotor loss and the reduction of stator loss from operation near unity power factor. In PM machines, iron losses form a significant fraction of the total loss partly due to the nonsinusoidal flux density distribution. Design optimization therefore requires good means of predicting these iron losses. Finite-element analysis can be employed but this approach is cumbersome and costly when used in the many iterations needed in optimizing the design. This paper presents a set of improved approximate models for the prediction of iron loss. They can be used in design optimization programs and, since they are directly related to machine dimensions and material properties, they also provide quick insight into the effects of design changes. A time-stepped finite-element method is employed to evaluate the iron losses in a range of typical PM machines and the results are used to evaluate the adequacy of the models. The predictions of overall iron losses are then compared with measurements made on two PM motors.},

It is shown that the reciprocity property can be extended to these cases, provided the losses are either negligible or modeled separately (as is usual in machine analysis).

  abstract  = {As an alternative to conventional wind turbines, this study considered kites with onboard wind turbines driven by a high airspeed due to crosswind flight (“drag power”). The Hypothesis of this study was, that if the kite's lift coefficient is maximized, then the power, energy yield, allowed costs and profit margin are also maximized. This hypothesis was confirmed based on a kite power system model extended from Loyd's model. The performance of small-scale and utility-scale kites in monoplane and biplane configurations were examined for increasing lift coefficients. Moreover, several parameters of the utility-scale system were optimized with a genetic algorithm. With an optimal lift coefficient of 4.5, the biplane outperformed the monoplane. A 40 m wing span kite was expected to achieve a rated power of about 4.1 MW with a power density of about 52 kW/m2. A parameter sensitivity analysis of the optimized design was performed. Moreover, to demonstrate the feasibility of very high lift coefficients and the validity of a utilized simplified airfoil polar model, CFDs of a proposed high-lift multi-element airfoil were performed and the airfoil polars were recorded. Finally, a planform design of a biplane kite was proposed.},

  abstract    = {This chapter provides an introduction to the modeling and control of power generation from wind turbine sys-
tems. In modeling, the focus is on the electrical components: electrical machine (e.g. permanent-magnet synchronous
generators), back-to-back converter (consisting of machine-side and grid-side converter sharing a common DC-link),
mains filters and ideal (balanced) power grid. The aerodynamics and the torque generation of the wind turbine
are explained in simplified terms using a so-called power coefficient. The overall control system is considered.
In particular, the phase-locked loop system for grid-side voltage orientation, the nonlinear speed control system
for the generator (and turbine), and the non-minimum phase DC-link voltage control system are discussed in
detail; based on a brief derivation of the underlying machine-side and grid-side current control systems. With the
help of the power balance of the wind turbine, the operation management and the control of the power flow are
explained. Concluding simulation results illustrate the overall system behavior of a controlled wind turbine with a
permanent-magnet synchronous generator.},

full-order observer for sensorless induction motor (IM) drives. A
general stabilizing observer gain matrix, having three free design
parameters, is used as a design framework. A gain-scheduled
selection of the free design parameters is proposed. Furthermore,
the full-order observer is augmented with the stator-resistance
adaptation, and the local stability of the augmented observer is
analyzed. The performance of the proposed full-order observer
design is experimentally compared with a reduced-order observer
using a 2.2-kW IM drive.},

derived for each design strategy, using which the general

solutions of all feasible gains facilitate the practical
implementation of the algorithms for any machine's

placement. New design rules for the feedback gains and the
adaptation gains which preserve the required performances
for all operating conditions. are also proposed.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes and formalizes a comprehen-
sive experimental approach for the identification of the magnetic
model of synchronous electrical machines of all kinds. The identifi-
cation procedure is based on controlling the current of the machine
under test while this is driven at constant speed by another
regenerative electric drive. Compensation of stator resistance and
inverter voltage drops, iron loss, and operating temperature issues
are all taken into account. A road map for implementation is given,
on different types of hardware setups. Experimental results are
presented, referring to two test motors of small size, and references
of larger motors identified with the same technique are given from
the literature.},

  abstract  = {We discuss the detection of rotational periodic torque deviations in variable speed wind turbine systems. These deviations can be caused by faults in the system. The turbine torque is estimated with an observer and an estimate of the ideal aerodynamical torque is calculated. These torques are analysed using a phase-locked loop to detect deviations. The torque observer is based on the model of the turbine drive train. It is modelled as a two-mass-system with a flexible shaft. The design of the observer and the phase-locked loop are shown and their stability is discussed. Simulations show, that the presented concept is capable of detecting the amplitude of the deviations at different periodicities, online and for variable speed.},

  abstract  = {This paper investigates efficiency enhancements in Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSMs) used as generators in wave energy converters. A method is presented, which allows experimental identification of the optimal current vectors leading to minimal losses and maximum efficiency. Iron and inverter losses are considered. The proposed identification method is generic and is applicable to any PMSM used as a generator. The obtained results are compared to the well-known Maximum Torque per Current (MTPC) strategy. Two MTPC strategies are investigated: (i) MTPC using linearised flux linkages; and (ii) MTPC using measured, nonlinear flux linkages. For both MTPC strategies, the influence of the Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) is taken into account. All measurements are performed on a simple and cheap industrial-like test bench. All three presented methods lead to increased efficiency. The best efficiency is obtained by the proposed maximum efficiency strategy, where iron and inverter losses are taken into account by proper measurement of the optimal current vectors.},

  abstractnote = {Induction motor parameters are essential for high-performance control. However, motor parameters vary because of winding temperature rise, skin effect, and flux saturation. Mismatched parameters will consequently lead to motor performance degradation. To provide accurate motor parameters, in this paper, a comprehensive review of offline and online identification methods is presented. In the implementation of offline identification, either a DC voltage or single-phase AC voltage signal is injected to keep the induction motor standstill, and the corresponding identification algorithms are discussed in the paper. Moreover, the online parameter identification methods are illustrated, including the recursive least square, model reference adaptive system, DC and high-frequency AC voltage injection, and observer-based techniques, etc. Simulations on selected identification techniques applied to an example induction motor are presented to demonstrate their performance and exemplify the parameter identification methods.},

alized Integrators (mSOGIs) for a fast estimation of all harmonic
components of arbitrarily distorted single-phase signals such
as voltages or currents in power systems. The estimation is
based on the internal model principle leading to an overall
observer consisting of parallelized mSOGIs. The observer is
tuned by pole placement. For a constant fundamental frequency,
the observer is capable of estimating all harmonic components
with prescribed settling time by choosing the observer poles
appropriately. For time-varying fundamental frequencies, the
harmonic estimation is combined with a modified Frequency
Locked Loop (mFLL) with gain normalization, sign-correct anti-
windup and rate limitation. The estimation performances of
the proposed parallelized mSOGIs with and without mFLL are
illustrated and validated by measurement results. The results are
compared to standard approaches such as parallelized standard
SOGIs (sSOGIs) and adaptive notch filters (ANFs).},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a method for online detection of symmetrical components of arbitrarily distorted and biased three-phase input signals. This method is based on Second-Order Generalized Integrators (SOGIs), for which a new tuning based on a gradient search is presented to achieve the fastest possible estimation. Frequency estimation is achieved by a Frequency Locked Loop (FLL) with Gain Normalization (GN) for which an Output Saturation (OS) is applied; this OS guarantees stability of the overall system. Offset detection is implemented by a combination of High-Pass Filter (HPF) and HPF-Amplitude Phase Correction (APC); the HPF filters out any offset, where the APC reconstructs the original offset-free signal. An identical method (APC) can be used for the implemented Low-Pass Filter (LPF) used for noise filtering. The resulting estimates are then used for Harmonic Sequence Detection (HSD) of each harmonic. For the overall system, stability is proven. The estimation performances of the proposed overall system are verified by simulation results. The improvements in tuning and offset detection are compared to standard approaches.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a finite set model predictive control (FS-MPC) system for active front-end (AFE) converters in combination with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for on-line parameter estimation to overcome the issues of parameter uncertainty and measurement noise. The FS-MPC performance of such converters is largely affected by variations in the model impedance (filter impedance and grid impedance), especially for systems with low short circuit ratios. Therefore, an EKF is used to estimate these model parameters on-line. Moreover, the EKF is used to filter out measurement noise in the feedback variables. For implementation of the FS-MPC, the discrete-time models of the AFE converter and the filter are derived using two discretization methods (forward Euler method and Taylor series expansion). The observability matrix of the linearized model is computed, and the observability is checked for each time instant to verify that the EKF is working properly. Moreover, the delay time due to the digital calculation is compensated. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated via simulation results.},

DCI and mSOGIs are tuned by pole placement which allows for an arbitrarily fast detection of dc-offset and harmonic components if the fundamental frequency is known. If the fundamental frequency must be estimated as well, an mFLL with Gain Normalization (GN), Rate Limitation (RL), Anti-Windup (AW) strategy and low-pass filters (LPF) must be employed. The effectiveness of the proposed FAO is validated by experimental results and its enhanced performance is shown and compared to existing estimation methods.},

The usual controller designs would fail and result in instability. The proposed controller has a cascaded structure with a current controller as inner control loop and an outer dc-link voltage controller. The controller design is performed in discrete time and it is based on a detailed stability analysis of the dc-link voltage controller to determine the controller parameters which guarantee stability for all operating points. The inner loop is a state-feedback current controller that is designed based on the discrete linear-quadratic regulator (DLQR) theory. An additional integral error feedback assures steady-state accuracy of the current control loop. The simulation and experimental results validate performance and stability of proposed controller design.},

  abstract  = {Fault detection and isolation (FDI) strategies can be implemented to increase reliability and prevent faults of power switches from disrupting converter operation. This is especially important for Modular Multilevel Cascade Converters (MMCC) due to the high number of switches employed in this topology. This paper proposes a new model for chopper cells, the core component of an MMCC. Unlike reported methods, the proposed model enables open-circuit fault detection and excellent tracking of cluster currents using a Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) under normal and faulty operation. The model has been successfully validated to detect faulty operation by using PLECS simulations in a BTB MMCC-DSCC.},

The output terminals of the MMCC-DS are connected to a general resistive-inductive (RL) load with additional voltage sources in star connection. The model is derived and described in detail by using Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws (KCL, KVL) and allows for currents flowing through the anti-parallel diodes of the active switches in each cell. The model is implemented in Matlab/Simulink 2019b and PLECS for a simulative validation and comparison of the proposed model.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the development and performance analysis of model reference adaptive controller using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for Brushless DC motor (BLDC) drives. The model reference adaptive systems (MRAS) have a parameter adjustment mechanism along with the normal feedback loop and hence give better solutions when there are variations in process parameters. Neural networks (NNs) with their inherent parallelism, learning capabilities and fault tolerance have proven to be a promising solution in estimating and controlling nonlinear systems. This paper combines a MRAS with ANN to solve the problems of non-linearity, parameter variations and load excursions that occur in BLDC motor drive systems. The performance of the traditional PID controller based speed control method is compared with the model reference based speed control for BLDC motor drive system using MATLAB Simulink software. Experimental results using TMS320LF2407A is presented to prove that the MRAC based model is capable of speed tracking as well as reduce the effect of parameter variations.},

  abstract         = {We introduce a method to train Binarized Neu- ral Networks (BNNs) - neural networks with bi- nary weights and activations at run-time. At training-time the binary weights and activations are used for computing the parameters gradi- ents. During the forward pass, BNNs drastically reduce memory size and accesses, and replace most arithmetic operations with bit-wise opera- tions, which is expected to substantially improve power-efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of BNNs we conduct two sets of experiments on the Torch7 and Theano frameworks. On both, BNNs achieved nearly state-of-the-art results over the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets. Last but not least, we wrote a binary matrix multiplication GPU kernel with which it is possible to run our MNIST BNN 7 times faster than with an unopti- mized GPU kernel, without suffering any loss in classification accuracy. The code for training and running our BNNs is available on-line.},

  abstract         = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  abstract   = {Electrically excited synchronous motor (EESM) has the characteristics of high order, nonlinear and strong coupling, so it is difficult to be controlled. However, it has the advantages of adjustable power factor, high efficiency, and high precision torque control, so it is widely used in high-power applications. The accuracy of a flux observer influences the speed control system of EESM. Based on state observer in modern control theory and electrical excitation synchronous machine state equation, a reduced-order flux observer is designed. Using the first-order difference method and forward bilinear transformation method, the reduced-order flux observer is discrete, and the stability of the motor system is analyzed. The analysis shows that the stability of the system using the bilinear transformation method is better than that using the first order forward difference method. In motor operation, motor parameters will be affected by the factors of temperature, magnetic saturation, and motor frequency. In this paper, the influence of parameter variation on the motor system is studied by using the variation of the pole distribution. Finally, the speed regulation system using the reduced-order observer is simulated, which verifies the accuracy of the reduced-order flux observer observation.},

  abstract         = {Validation can be used to detect when overfitting starts during supervised training of a neural network; training is then stopped before convergence to avoid the overfitting (``early stopping''). The exact criterion used for validation-based early stopping, however, is usually chosen in an ad-hoc fashion or training is stopped interactively. This trick describes how to select a stopping criterion in a systematic fashion; it is a trick for either speeding learning procedures or improving generalization, whichever is more important in the particular situation. An empirical investigation on multi-layer perceptrons shows that there exists a tradeoff between training time and generalization: From the given mix of 1296 training runs using difierent 12 problems and 24 difierent network architectures I conclude slower stopping criteria allow for small improvements in generalization (here: about 4{\%} on average), but cost much more training time (here: about factor 4 longer on average).},

However, a severe challenge faced by deep learning is the high dependency on hyper-parameters. The algorithm results may fluctuate dramatically under the different configuration of hyper-parameters. Addressing the above issue, this paper presents an efficient Orthogonal Array Tuning Method (OATM) for deep learning hyper-parameter tuning. We describe the OATM approach in five detailed steps and elaborate on it using two widely used deep neural network structures (Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks). The proposed method is compared to the state-of-the-art hyper-parameter tuning methods including manually (e.g., grid search and random search) and automatically (e.g., Bayesian Optimization) ones. The experiment results state that OATM can significantly save the tuning time compared to the state-of-the-art methods while preserving the satisfying performance.},

Currently, the trending research line in HAR is applying deep learning to extract features and classify activities from raw data. However, we observed that, authors of previous studies have not performed an efficient hyperparameter search on their artificial neural network (shallow or deep)-based classifier. Therefore, in this article, we demonstrate the effect of the random and Bayesian parameter search on a shallow neural network using five HAR databases. The result of this work shows that a shallow neural network with correct parameter optimization can achieve similar or even better recognition accuracy than the previous best deep classifier(s) on all databases. In addition, we draw conclusions about the advantages and disadvantages of the two hyperparameter search techniques according to the results.},

The study focuses on a low-rank coal reserve located in the K\i n\i k coalfield, which was investigated using the United States Bureau of Mines (USBM) direct desorption method to anticipate the total desorbed gas content of coal seams for underground mining operations. The core samples collected during the reserve and gas content analysis were used to feed machine learning models, which were trained using coal properties data such as depth, moisture, ash, volatile matter, and calorific value, in relation to total desorbed gas content. Multiple linear regression, support vector machine, and artificial neural network were employed to predict the total desorbed gas content of coal seams in the K\i n\i k coalfield. The machine learning models were optimized using hyperparameter tuning, and the most successful model was selected based on its regression and computational cost performance. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the performance of the coal properties on total desorbed gas content. The selected model was then utilized for predicting the total desorbed gas content of coal seams at a single point in the coalfield. The findings of this study provide insights and guidelines for unconventional reservoir analysis and petrophysical system prediction using machine learning methods. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of machine learning in addressing nonlinear problems in the field of geology and provides a promising approach for future research in this area.},

Seven parameters were identified as influential factors for pressure drop and liquid hold-up. Two correlations for the responses were proposed using the two-factor interaction (2FI) model based on the RSM-central composite design approach. In the ANN modeling, two algorithms were applied: multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF). The optimal MLP structure using the Bayesian Regularization (trainbr) algorithm had two hidden layers, 16 and 8 neurons, and the optimal RBF structure had 42 neurons. The best MSE performance of the MLP network was 0.0938 and 0.0083 for pressure drop and hold-up, respectively, at 16 epochs. The best MSE performance of the RBF network was 0.0685 and 0.0140 for pressure drop and hold-up, respectively, at 42 epochs. Both the ANN and RSM models provided reliable predictions of the experimental data. In addition, ANN's prediction performance (R2 = 0.993) was somewhat better than RSM's (R2 = 0.926). The results showed that gas factor and liquid load had the greatest effect on pressure drop and liquid hold-up, respectively.},

The current practices of designing neural networks rely heavily on subjective judgment and heuristic steps, often dictated by the level of expertise possessed by architecture designers. To alleviate these challenges and streamline the design process, we propose an automatic method, a novel approach to enhance the optimization of neural network architectures for processing intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) data. Approach. We present a genetic algorithm, which optimizes neural network architecture and signal pre-processing parameters for iEEG classification. Main results. Our method improved the macro F1 score of the state-of-the-art model in two independent datasets, from St. Anne's University Hospital (Brno, Czech Republic) and Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN, USA), from 0.9076 to 0.9673 and from 0.9222 to 0.9400 respectively. Significance. By incorporating principles of evolutionary optimization, our approach reduces the reliance on human intuition and empirical guesswork in architecture design, thus promoting more efficient and effective neural network models. The proposed method achieved significantly improved results when compared to the state-of-the-art benchmark model (McNemar's test, p {$\ll$} 0.01). The results indicate that neural network architectures designed through machine-based optimization outperform those crafted using the subjective heuristic approach of a human expert. Furthermore, we show that well-designed data preprocessing significantly affects the models' performance.},

This study presents an artificial neural network (ANN) that recommends the most suitable EOR method based on historical reservoir data. Data from EOR projects worldwide were collected, pre-processed, and then used to build the ANN, which initially achieved a 69\% accuracy. The neural network was optimized using the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) and compared with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, with a focus on weight and hyperparameter optimization. Validation of the neural network's prediction was done using recall, precision, and the F1 score. Weight optimization yielded an accuracy of 68\% with SSA and 34\% with PSO, which were insufficient results for EOR prediction. However, hyperparameter optimization was applied, resulting in an accuracy of 94\% with SSA and 90\% with PSO. The SSA approach demonstrated faster convergence and higher accuracy in both optimization paths, highlighting its potential for optimizing the neural network in predicting the appropriate EOR method for a given reservoir.},

  abstract         = {It is critical to accurately predict the heat transfer performance of heat pipes with nanofluids for the design of the thermal management system. The current prediction models for the thermal performance of heat pipe with nanofluids are mostly developed based solely on their experimental data, resulting in poor universality and low predictive performance. Moreover, there is a lack of quantitative analysis of the correlation degree of selected input parameters on the thermal performance of heat pipe. The innovation of this work lies in the development of a novel thermal resistance prediction model based on neural network and sensitivity analysis method, charac\- terized by a broad range of inputs and high accuracy. Firstly, a neural network database was established based on our own experimental data and published literature. The effects of the learning rate and the number of nodes in the hidden layer on the prediction performance were investigated. Subsequently, the Garson algorithm was used for sensitivity analysis of the input parameters. The results showed that when the Adam adaptive optimization algorithm and 28 nodes in the hidden layer were used, the neural network model had the highest prediction accuracy, with a mean square error (MSE) of only 0.0020 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.03 K/W, and a mean relative error (MRE) of 7.86 \%, demonstrating that the developed model can be used for predicting the performance of heat pipes. The ranking of the influence of each input variable on the thermal resistance from high to low is as follows: heat load, confinement number, inclination angle, cold source temperature, filling ratio, thermal conductivity, and concentration. Moreover, the influence of concentration on the accuracy of the model cannot be ignored. This work provides a direct guidance for developing a performance prediction model for heat pipe with nanofluids with high universality and accuracy.},

Recently, though, algorithms have appeared that focus on optimizing multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously. This article presents a systematic survey of the literature published between 2014 and 2020 on multi-objective HPO algorithms, distinguishing between metaheuristic-based algorithms, metamodel-based algorithms and approaches using a mixture of both.

Several techniques have been developed and successfully applied for certain application domains. However, this work demands professional knowledge and expert experience. And sometimes it has to resort to the brute-force search. Therefore, if an efficient hyperparameter optimization algorithm can be developed to optimize any given machine learning method, it will greatly improve the efficiency of machine learning. In this paper, we consider building the relationship between the performance of the machine learning models and their hyperparameters by Gaussian processes. In this way, the hyperparameter tuning problem can be abstracted as an optimization problem and Bayesian optimization is used to solve the problem. Bayesian optimization is based on the Bayesian theorem. It sets a prior over the optimization function and gathers the information from the previous sample to update the posterior of the optimization function. A utility function selects the next sample point to maximize the optimization function. Several experiments were conducted on standard test datasets. Experiment results show that the proposed method can find the best hyperparameters for the widely used machine learning models, such as the random forest algorithm and the neural networks, even multi-grained cascade forest under the consideration of time cost.},
